\section{Exercise 1.1.1}

The following sequence is the minimum:
\begin{align*}
t&\leftarrow a\\
a&\leftarrow b\\
b&\leftarrow c\\
c&\leftarrow d\\
d&\leftarrow t\\
\end{align*}

\section{Exercise 1.1.2}

\begin{proof}
After the start, step E1 can only be reached by step E3. However, after E3 has 
finished, $m$ will have the previous value of $n$, and $n$ will have the
remainder of the division of $m$ by $n$. The remainer will always be smaller
than the divisor, by definition, so $n$ will be always smaller than $m$.

\chapter{1.2 Mathematical Induction}

\section{Exercise 1.2.1}

Start by proving the truth of $P(0)$, and then proceed as usual.

\section{Exercise 1.2.2}

This is a recurrence with two variables: $a(n+1)=F(a(n),a(n-1))$. The 
induction basis should have two elements, however it was proved only
for $a(1)$. You should have proved either $a(0)$ or $a(2)$ to have a valid 
proof.
